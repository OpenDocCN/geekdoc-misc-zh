- en: 'All the interactions from the client side have been fairly low-level: you have
    to manually create a response channel, build the command, send it to the server,
    and then call `recv` on the response channel to get the response.'

  zh: 客户端的所有交互都相当底层：你必须手动创建响应通道，构建命令，将其发送到服务器，然后在对响应通道调用`recv`以获取响应。
- en: This is a lot of boilerplate code that could be abstracted away, and that's
    exactly what we're going to do in this exercise.
