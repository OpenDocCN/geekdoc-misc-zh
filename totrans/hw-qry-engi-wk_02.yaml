- en: The first edition of this book was written in a one week break between jobs
    and improved during COVID lockdown in 2020\. I honestly wasn’t sure how many people
    wanted to read a book about building a query engine from scratch. It turns out
    that there are quite a few.

    code organization, and expanded coverage of topics like joins, subqueries, and
    distributed query execution.

- en: This book is not academic in nature. It aims to be a practical, straightforward
    guide. The feedback from readers has been encouraging, so thank you to everyone
    who provided suggestions and corrections. I hope this edition serves as an even
    better foundation for understanding query engines.
