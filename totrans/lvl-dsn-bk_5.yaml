  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A **blockout** (also **blockmesh** or **graybox**) is a 3D rough draft level
    built with simple 3D shapes, but without any details or polished art assets.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The goal is to prototype, test, and adjust the foundational shapes of the level.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the image below, notice the differences between the blockout version and
    the final shipped version. A shape might start as a gray block -- then after months
    of [playtesting](/process/blockout/playtesting) and [art passing](/process/env-art),
    the block becomes a stack of barrels... or maybe gets deleted entirely.

    Campo Santo wanted to focus on mechanics like walking and talking; the main appeal
    of the game concept was looking at art passed scenery and listening to voice acted
    dialogue. Following typical best practices, they first built a blockout to test
    the viability of these mechanics. However, the blockout did not help them answer
    any questions about the player experience because the game pacing was fundamentally
    a narrative design and environment art issue, not so much a level design issue.
    The traditional blockout process wasn't working.

- en: For the top-down third person stealth puzzle game Untitled Goose Game, developer
    House House sought to create an authentic-feeling British village in 3D. Level
    designer Jake Strasser had never been in the UK, so blocked out the initial level
    with occasional use of photo reference. However, this blockout-first approach
    required Strasser to fill-in gaps from his imagination -- and because he didn't
    have a British imagination, these gaps often felt implausible or inauthentic in
    subtle ways, counter to their intent. The traditional blockout process wasn't
    working.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So instead, Strasser tried a [research](/process/preproduction/research)-first
    "location scouting" approach. He went on an exhaustive virtual tour of various
    UK villages, taking lots of photos from Google Street View. After recreating several
    village streets in-game, Strasser finally pin-pointed what type of structure suited
    the game's needs, and settled on an unusual side street layout based on [Pump
    Street in the village of Orford](https://goo.gl/maps/WAkqYmNRARyAEimi9). Here,
    blockout was less about building a space, and more about discovering a space.
