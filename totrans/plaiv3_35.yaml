    the act of calling associates (“binds”) the formal parameters with the actual
    values.

    outside that region.

    “visible” or whatever other phrase you would like; formally, we would say, it
    depends on whether `y`is in scope. Specifically, we’d ask whether the last `y`is
    a boundinstance of the bindingthat takes place in the `for`.

    unintuitive things, as you will see from Mystery Languages. These odd things are
    not really part of SMoL; if anything, they are a violation of it.
