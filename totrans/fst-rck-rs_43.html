<h1>Concurrency</h1>
<blockquote>原文：<a href="https://freddiehaddad.github.io/fast-track-to-rust/concurrency.html">https://freddiehaddad.github.io/fast-track-to-rust/concurrency.html</a></blockquote>
                        
<p>We're nearing the end of the course, and there's no better way to wrap things up
than with concurrency! Rust, like many other languages, includes a native
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/thread/">thread</a> module for spawning threads and performing tasks in parallel. However,
numerous crates build on Rust's native multithreading capabilities, simplifying
the process and offering various threading patterns.</p>
<p>For instance, if you've programmed in Go, you're likely familiar with channels
for moving data between <code>goroutines</code>. Similarly, if you've worked with
JavaScript, you probably know about <code>async</code> and <code>await</code>. Both of these
paradigms, along with many others, are available as crates in Rust.</p>
<p>Here's a few examples worth exploring:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://crates.io/crates/crossbeam">crossbeam</a></strong>: A set of tools for concurrent programming</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://crates.io/crates/rayon">rayon</a></strong>: A data-parallelism library for Rust.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://crates.io/crates/tokio">tokio</a></strong>: An event-driven, non-blocking I/O platform for writing
asynchronous I/O backed applications.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's dive into multithreading!</p>
