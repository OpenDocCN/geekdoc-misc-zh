- en: 'Starting with the first edition, this book’s target has been “the other 90%”.
    That is, I conjecture that roughly 10% of students in a programming languages
    class are like the educator: they are deeply excited about and motivated to learn
    the subject, identify with it personally, and may want to continue to study it
    further. These are wonderful students, and many of them will go on to become the
    next generation of educators. There are several terrific books that are designed—or
    at least, work best—for this kind of student.'

- en: But most of them—say 90%—may not have this deep personal identification. Instead,
    they want to learn the subject enough to become better computer scientists. What
    do they need to learn, and how do they need to learn it? They are the target audience
    for this book. On the one hand, the book tries to connect to many programming
    tasks. At the same time, it’s too easy to pander to such an audience. The book
    tries to balance these connections with a focus on principles that will stand
    the learner in good stead for a long time.

    If nothing else, they may learn a different perspective on the subject, and maybe
    also develop some empathy for learners not like themselves. If nothing else, well
    over a dozen students who used earlier editions of this book successfully completed
    PhDs in programming languages, and several are themselves professors now. So,
    at least, the book has not harmed them. I can live with those odds.

- en: I have also written this book with working programmers in mind. Many of them
    may have not had a formal computer science education, or at least one that included
    a proper introduction to programming languages. At some point, like that 90% of
    students, some of them become curious about the media they use. I want this book
    to speak to them, gently drawing them away from the hustle and bustle of daily
    programming into a space of reflection and thought.
