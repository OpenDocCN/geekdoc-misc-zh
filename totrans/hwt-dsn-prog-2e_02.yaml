    When it works, students exclaim “It works!” and move on. Sadly, this phrase is

    relies on systematic thought, planning, and understanding from the very beginning,
    at every stage, and for every step. To emphasize the point, we speak of systematic
    program design and systematically designed programs. Critically, the latter articulates
    the rationale of the desired functionality. Good programming also satisfies an
    aesthetic sense of accomplishment; the elegance of a good program is comparable
    to time-tested poems or the black-and-white photographs of a bygone era. In short,
    programming differs from good programming like crayon sketches in a diner from
    oil paintings in a museum.

    book deals with just two recipes for complete programs: one for programs with
    a graphical user interface (GUI) and one for batch programs. In contrast, design
    recipes for functions come in a wide variety of flavors: for atomic forms of data
    such as numbers; for enumerations of different kinds of data; for data that compounds
    other data in a fixed manner; for finite but arbitrarily large data; and so on.'

    outcome(s); the “commands” suggest the key activities. Examples play a central
    role at almost every stage.Instructors Have students copy [figure 1](#%28counter._%28figure._fig~3athe-design-recipe%29%29)
    on one side of an index card. When students are stuck, ask them to produce their
    card and point them to the step where they are stuck. For the chosen data representation
    in step 1, writing down examples proves how real-world information is encoded
    as data and how data is interpreted as information. Step 3 says that a problem-solver
    must work through concrete scenarios to gain an understanding of what the desired
    function is expected to compute for specific examples. This understanding is exploited
    in step 5, when it is time to define the function. Finally, step 6 demands that
    examples are turned into automated test code, which ensures that the function
    works properly for some cases. Running the function on real-world data may reveal
    other discrepancies between expectations and results.

    definition. The answers almost automatically create an intermediate product.Instructors
    The most important questions are those for steps 4 and 5\. Ask students to write
    down these questions in their own words on the back of their index card. This

    the completion of the function definition. And even then, help is available in

    programs. When a novice is stuck, an expert or an instructor can inspect the existing
    intermediate products. The inspection is likely to use the generic questions from
    the design process and thus drive the novice to correct himself or herself. And
    this self-empowering process is the key difference between programming and program
    design.

    Getting everything right at once is nearly impossible. Instead, computer scientists
    borrow iterative refinement from the physical sciences to tackle this design problem.
    In essence, iterative refinement recommends stripping away all inessential details
    at first and finding a solution for the remaining core problem. A refinement step
    adds in one of these omitted details and re-solves the expanded problem, using
    the existing solution as much as possible. A repetition, also called an iteration,
    of these refinement steps eventually leads to a complete solution.

    models for some idealized version of the world to make predictions about it. As
    long as the model’s predictions come true, everything is fine; when the predicted
    events differ from the actual ones, scientists revise their models to reduce the
    discrepancy. In a similar vein, when programmers are given a task, they create
    a first design, turn it into code, evaluate it with actual users, and iteratively
    refine the design until the program’s behavior closely matches the desired product.

    via refinement becomes useful even when the design of programs becomes complex,

    acquire a certain degree of difficulty. Furthermore, we use iterative refinement
    to state increasingly complex variants of the same problem over the course of
    the first three parts of the book. That is, we pick a core problem, deal with
    it in one chapter, and then pose a similar problem in a subsequent chapter—<wbr>with

    programming language often sets up students for eventual failure. Fashion in this

    as well as for 10,000-line programs. It takes some reflection to adopt the design

    once the process becomes second nature, its use pays off in many ways.

    skills. Program design certainly teaches the same analytical skills as mathematics,
    especially (pre)algebra and geometry. But, unlike mathematics, working with programs
    is an active approach to learning. Creating software provides immediate feedback
    and thus leads to exploration, experimentation, and self-evaluation. The results
    tend to be interactive products, an approach that vastly increases the sense of
    accomplishment when compared to drill exercises in textbooks.

    analytical reading and writing skills. Even the smallest design tasks are formulated

    bottom-up construction phase. We explicitly show how the interface to libraries
    dictates the shape of certain program elements. In particular, the very first
    phase of a program design yields a wish list of functions. While the concept of
    a wish list exists in the first edition, this second edition treats it as an explicit
    design element.

    others. This design-by-composition is especially useful for the world of batch
    programs. Like generative recursion,We thank Kathi Fisler for calling our attention
    to this point. it requires a eureka!, specifically a recognition that the creation
    of intermediate data by one function and processing this intermediate result by
    a second function simplifies the overall design. This approach also needs a wish
    list, but formulating these wishes calls for an insightful development of an intermediate
    data definition. This edition of the book weaves in a number of explicit exercises
    on design by composition.
