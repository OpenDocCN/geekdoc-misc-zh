    a value. It's essentially a placeholder indicating the absence of a meaningful
    value.

    to work with parts of a string without needing to own the entire string, making
    them efficient and flexible.

- en: Signed 32-bit integers `i32` are integers that can store both positive and negative
    values within a specific range. They are commonly used for numerical operations
    where the size of the number is known and fits within the 32-bit limit.

    in Rust, and it's usually seen in its borrowed^([1](#footnote-1)) form `&str`.

    the string literal `"rust"`. This block of memory would store the individual bytes
    representing each character in the string. In this case, the memory would contain
    the bytes for `'r'`, `'u'`, `'s'`, and `'t'`, sequentially stored starting from
    address 0x10.
