    Conditionals, we will now examine how to extend our language to also support conditionals.
    There can be quite complex conditional expressions in real languages, but for
    our purposes it will suffice to have an `if` with three parts: the conditional,
    the then-branch, and the else-branch. Later, when we learn how to extend the language,
    we can see how to layer more sophisticated conditional expressions atop this.'
