[crates.io](https://crates.io/) is the central [package registry](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/appendix/glossary.html#registry) for the Rust community, serving as a hub to discover and download packages. `cargo` supports adding and managing [dependencies](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/guide/dependencies.html) for you and is configured to use the [package registry](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/appendix/glossary.html#registry) by default.

We're going to explore a few crates in this course:

*   **[regex](https://crates.io/crates/regex)**: An implementation of regular expressions for Rust
*   **[itertools](https://crates.io/crates/itertools)**: Extra iterator adaptors, iterator methods, free functions, and macros
*   **[clap](https://crates.io/crates/clap)**: A simple to use, efficient, and full-featured Command Line Argument Parser
