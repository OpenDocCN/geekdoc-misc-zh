- en: My group’s PhD students, especially Jack Wrenn, have tolerated years of my complaining
    about my course. Amidst their eye-rolling they heard me out, batted away my worst
    ideas, and fleshed out my better ones. I am deeply fortunate to be able to work
    with them.

    and our conversations reminded me how much I have missed his company.

    numerous of the materials that make it possible. He has not only collaborated
    on but actively leads many of the materials that power or augment this book. His
    dissertation research will likely lead to significant improvements in how we teach
    programming languages.

- en: Matthew Flatt’s fingerprints are all over this book. I especially thank him
    for the Racket ecosystem and the `#lang` concept, which also drove the redesign
    of this book, and for the plait language especially, which is central to much
    of this book’s code.

    To the people who made it happen and keep it alive, many thanks, and may the winds
    always be at your back (which they often can be, if you ride south and then back
    north between 2pm and 4pm).

    and support of Kathi and Tara, who alsotolerated years of my complaining about
    my course and provided their own eye-rolling support. They are my rocks.
