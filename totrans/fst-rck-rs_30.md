## [Adding a Dependency](#adding-a-dependency)

Adding dependencies is as simple as specifying the name of the crate and the desired version^([1](#footnote-1)) in the `[dependencies]` section of the `Cargo.toml` file. Here's how we add the `regex` crate.

# [Exercise](#exercise)

> These exercises must be completed locally.

*   Add the `clap` crate and include the `derive`^([2](#footnote-2)) feature. More information to accomplish this can be found [here](https://crates.io/crates/clap) and [here](https://docs.rs/clap/latest/clap/_derive/_tutorial/chapter_0/index.html).

1.  Semantic version numbers (i.e. [SemVer](https://semver.org/)) are supported. Refer to the documentation on [specifying dependencies](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/specifying-dependencies.html#specifying-dependencies) for more advanced version control. [↩](#fr-1-1)

2.  Features of dependencies can be enabled within the dependency declaration. The features key indicates which features to enable. The [Cargo Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/index.html) covers this under the [Dependency features](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/features.html#dependency-features) section.
