    answer these questions. You did something similar in middle- and high-school algebra
    classes. You probably learned the phrase substitution for “replaced with”. That’s
    the same process we’re following here. And indeed, we can think of programming
    as a natural outgrowth of algebra, except with much more interesting datatypes:
    not only numbers but also strings, images, lists, tables, vector fields, videos,
    and more.'
