<h1>Installation</h1>

<p>Most exercises in this book can be completed in your web browser, with a few
exceptions. However, it is recommended to install the Rust development toolchain
on your system. Once installed, you'll have everything you need to build and run
Rust code locally.</p>
<p>Installation is accomplished using <code>rustup</code>, the Rust toolchain installer. Once
completed, you'll have <code>rustup</code>, <code>cargo</code>, and <code>rustc</code>.</p>
<p>Follow the instructions at <a href="https://rustup.rs/">https://rustup.rs/</a> to complete the installation.</p>
<h2 id="configuring-your-ide"><a class="header" href="#configuring-your-ide">Configuring your IDE</a></h2>
<p>It is recommended (but not required) to configure your editor to work with Rust.
With Cargo installed, most editors, such as VS Code, will automatically install
<a href="https://rust-analyzer.github.io/">rust-analyzer</a>, the LSP implementation for the Rust programming language.</p>
