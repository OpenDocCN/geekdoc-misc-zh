<h1>Ownership</h1>
<blockquote>原文：<a href="https://freddiehaddad.github.io/fast-track-to-rust/ownership.html">https://freddiehaddad.github.io/fast-track-to-rust/ownership.html</a></blockquote>
                        
<p>Ownership and borrowing are fundamental principles in Rust that ensure memory
safety without needing a garbage collector. Ownership dictates how memory is
managed, while borrowing allows you to reference data without taking ownership.
Understanding these concepts is crucial for writing efficient and safe Rust
programs.</p>
<p>The Rust documentation provides an in-depth exploration of these topics in
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch04-00-understanding-ownership.html">Understanding Ownership</a>, and it's highly recommended to spend some time
reading that material. For now, let's focus on the core principles of ownership.</p>
<h2 id="core-principles"><a class="header" href="#core-principles">Core Principles</a></h2>
<p>Keep these rules about ownership in mind as we progress through the course:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each value in Rust has an owner.</li>
<li>There can only be one owner at a time.</li>
<li>When the owner goes out of scope, the value is <em>dropped</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-1-1"><a href="#footnote-1">1</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<ol class="footnote-definition"><li id="footnote-1">
<p>The term <em>dropped</em> means the memory is freed and the object's lifetime has
ended. <a href="#fr-1-1">↩</a></p>
</li>
</ol>
