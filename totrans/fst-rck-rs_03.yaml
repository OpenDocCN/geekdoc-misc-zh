- en: Most exercises in this book can be completed in your web browser, with a few
    exceptions. However, it is recommended to install the Rust development toolchain
    on your system. Once installed, you'll have everything you need to build and run
    Rust code locally.

    completed, you'll have `rustup`, `cargo`, and `rustc`.

    With Cargo installed, most editors, such as VS Code, will automatically install
    [rust-analyzer](https://rust-analyzer.github.io/), the LSP implementation for
    the Rust programming language.
