- en: Now that we’ve seen what behavior we want, we should implement it. That is,
    we’ll extend our calculator to handle local binding (a feature you may well have
    wished your calculator had). To reflect that our calculator is growing up, from
    now on we’ll call it an interpreter, abbreviated in code to `interp`.

    are anyway orthogonal to our goal of handling local binding. Recall that we added
    two new branches to the BNF, so we’ll want two new corresponding branches to the
    AST:'

    we encounter a variable? In fact, these two should be intimately connected: the
    variable binding introduced by the former should substitute the variable use in
    the latter.'
