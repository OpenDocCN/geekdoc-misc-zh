- en: Before the 2000s, level designers often made their own environment art too.
    But today, a level designer is usually supposed to make as little visual art as
    possible, and the environment artist is usually supposed to wait for a mature
    [blockout](/process/blockout) before beginning an art pass. However, when working
    in a small team, level designers will likely have to source or make their own
    environment art, and vice versa.

    Dog artists used ivy coverage (see image above) to denote neglected closed buildings,
    while clearing ivy for open buildings that the player should enter. Also note
    how ivy flattens the structure of the facade. The player no longer has to inspect
    every window to wonder if it's navigable or relevant -- a building utterly consumed
    in ivy means it is closed, and resolves into a green blob. Thus, ivy functions
    as a simplifies the visual environment and serves as a navigation aid for the
    player. As long as all the designers and artists maintain consistency in how they

    color psychology are not effective for level design**. Abstract geometric shapes
    and colors, by themselves, do not make all humans feel the same thing nor communicate
    the same ideas. These simplistic theories fail to capture the rich complexity
    of art and culture, misunderstand basic psychology, and overshadow much more useful
    design tools. You're better off without them.

- en: Because Valorant is a competitive multiplayer shooter that depends on precise
    map [balance](/process/combat/balance), Riot tailored their art pass process to
    preserve the level designer's blockout as much as possible. Before entering art
    production and detailing phases, Valorant maps go through extensive month-long
    greybox ([blockout](/process/blockout)) and [playtest](/process/blockout/playtesting)
    phases as well as several initial *art blockout* passes to test color swatches
    and [massing](/process/blockout/massing). This *art blockout* gives extra time
    for level designers to make more changes to the level geometry, and propagate
    those tweaks back to the artists with minimal waste. Prolonging the blockout stage
    improves the final art pass and allows for more collaboration between departments.
