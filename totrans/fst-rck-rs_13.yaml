- en: Two lines of code were added to our rustle program on lines 13 and 18\. The
    variable `i` will get incremented with each loop iteration and we'll use it to
    print the line number. Go ahead and run the code.

    error messages.^([1](#footnote-1)) The variable `i` is immutable!

- en: Variables in Rust are immutable by default. This design choice helps you write
    code that leverages Rust's memory safety and fearless concurrency features. For
    more details, you can refer to the section on [variables and mutability](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch03-01-variables-and-mutability.html)
    in the Rust documentation. While the language encourages immutability, there are
    situations where mutating values is necessary. In such cases, we use the `mut`
    keyword.

- en: We're going to explore cases where immutability is needed and appropriate. However,
    let's see how iterators can be used to avoid the need for a mutable counter.
