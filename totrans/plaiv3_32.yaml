- en: 'It’s very important to keep in mind what the `num`and `bool`constructors stand
    for. Recall that this is abstract syntax: we are just (abstractly) representing
    the program that the user wrote, not the result of its evaluation. Therefore,
    these constructors are capturing syntactic constantsin the source program: values
    like `3.14`and `-1`for the former and `#true`and `#false`for the latter. They
    do notrepresent compound expressions that will evaluate to numbers or Booleans.
    What an expression will evaluate to, for now, can only be determined by running
    it. Later [[👉](PLAIVersion3.2.2_split_088.html#h.7rb3ecnk20em)], we will see there
    are other ways of doing it too!'

    instance, we may write numbers as `3`or as `III`. We might write Boolean values
    as `#t`, `#true`, `true`, `True`, …. We may even have different concrete syntaxes
    for the same abstract syntax. This is precisely the abstraction that abstract
    syntax provides!

    and more.'
