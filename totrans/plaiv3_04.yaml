    now, the book is part of a broader learning ecosystem, which is the course CSCI
    1730 at Brown University. All the materials are available from the following site:'

- en: The course’s work is divided into four “threads”. One thread, SMoL, uses an
    automated tutor to teach students SMoL. A second thread, ML, makes students work
    through mystery languages. The third is the Implementation thread. The fourth
    is Analysis, which asks students to relate material they are learning in the class
    to real-world language contexts. I especially encourage educators to make use
    of the Analysis thread assignments in their classes.

    machine. Readers will find it useful to run SMoL programs in the Stacker and study
    how they behave.
