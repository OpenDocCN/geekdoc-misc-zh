- en: A package is a collection of one or more crates that provide a set of functionalities.
    It includes a `Cargo.toml` file that outlines how to build those crates. A package
    can contain multiple binary crates, but only one library crate at most. However,
    a package must contain at least one crate, whether it's a library or binary crate.
