- en: Iterators are pervasive in Rust, and delving into them in full detail would
    necessitate renaming this course to **Slow Track to Rust**. We'll cover the basics
    and direct you to the documentation for all the intricate details about [iterators](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch13-02-iterators.html#processing-a-series-of-items-with-iterators).

- en: The [Control Flow](./control_flow.html) section explained that the call to `lines()`
    in the `for` loop returns an iterator. We say that the `for` loop *consumes* the
    iterator. However, in Rust, we can do much more than just consume iterators!

- en: New iterators can be created using [iterator adaptors](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch13-02-iterators.html?search=#methods-that-produce-other-iterators).
    These adaptors generate new iterators that modify some aspect of the original.
    Let's use one to print line numbers.

- en: The `enumerate` function creates an iterator that yields the current iteration
    count along with the value from the previous iterator, as tuples^([1](#footnote-1))
    in the form `(index, value)`. In the loop, the type for `i` is `usize`, and the
    type for `line` is `&str`.

    return an iterator that includes only the items we want!

    picking up the pace! Let's break this down because this code snippet needs some
    unpacking.
