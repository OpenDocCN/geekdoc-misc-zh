- en: Our production rustle program now has the capability to access real files. However,
    the Rust Playground does not support opening files directly. To ensure this course
    remains functional in your web browser, we need to use an in-memory buffer to
    simulate a file. This technique of mocking an open file is also commonly used
    in unit testing, making it a valuable concept to explore.

- en: The [`Cursor`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/io/struct.Cursor.html) ^([1](#footnote-1))
    is used with in-memory buffers to provide [`Read`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/io/trait.Read.html)
    or [`Write`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/io/trait.Write.html) functionality.
    Without digressing too much, the `BufReader` we are using works on objects that
    implement the [`Read`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/io/trait.Read.html) trait.
    For now, think of a [trait](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch10-02-traits.html)
    as an interface in object-oriented programming languages, with some differences.

    start by updating the `read_file` function to accept any object that implements
    the `Read` trait as an argument.

    and instead, we directly call `read_file` with `mock_file`.

- en: Since we commented out the file handling code, some previously necessary imports
    are now unused. The `#![allow(unused_imports)]` attribute in Rust instructs the
    compiler to permit these unused imports without issuing warnings. We'll delve
    deeper into attributes when we discuss custom types and implement command line
    argument support.

    take a brief detour to learn about project management in Rust, which will allow
    us to use packages (also known as crates) to add this functionality.
