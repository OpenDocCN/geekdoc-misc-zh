    translate our thoughts into computer actions. Therefore, it’s critical that they
    do so precisely. This is why language implementations are some of the most tested
    software you can imagine (when’s the last time you were stopped by a bug in your
    language implementation?), and people who will tolerate bugs in just about any
    other software are much less forgiving of bugs in implementations.
