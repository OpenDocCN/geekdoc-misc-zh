Guaranteed matches are\nrequired in order to assign values to match expressions, or alternatively,\ndetermine the flow of execution.\n\nErroneous code example:\n\nenum Terminator {\n    HastaLaVistaBaby,\n    TalkToMyHand,\n}\n\nlet x = Terminator::HastaLaVistaBaby;\n\nmatch x { // error: non-exhaustive patterns: `HastaLaVistaBaby` not covered\n    Terminator::TalkToMyHand => {}\n}\n\nIf you encounter this error you must alter your patterns so that every possible\nvalue of the input type is matched. For types with a small number of variants\n(like enums) you should probably cover all cases explicitly. Alternatively, the\nunderscore `_` wildcard pattern can be added after all other patterns to match\n\"anything else\".
