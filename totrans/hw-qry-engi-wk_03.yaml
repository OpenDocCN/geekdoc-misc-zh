- en: Query engines are the invisible workhorses powering modern data infrastructure.
    Every time you run a SQL query against a database, execute a Spark job, or query
    a data lake, a query engine is transforming your high-level request into an efficient
    execution plan. Understanding how query engines work gives you insight into one
    of the most important abstractions in computing.

- en: This book takes a hands-on approach to demystifying query engines. Rather than
    surveying existing systems, we will build a fully functional query engine from
    scratch, covering each component in enough depth that you could implement your
    own.

    on top of the previous.

- en: Chapters 1 through 4 cover the foundations. We start with what a query engine
    is, then establish our foundation with Apache Arrow for the memory model, a type
    system for representing data, and data source abstractions for reading files.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Chapters 5 through 7 cover query representation. We define logical plans and
    expressions to represent queries abstractly, build a DataFrame API for constructing
    plans programmatically, and add SQL support so queries can be written in the familiar
    query language.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Chapters 8 through 10 cover execution. We translate logical plans into physical
    plans containing executable code, then cover joins and subqueries, two of the
    most complex operations in query processing.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Chapters 11 through 13 cover planning and optimization. We implement a query
    planner to automate the translation from logical to physical plans, build optimizer
    rules to transform plans into more efficient forms, and execute queries to compare
    performance.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Chapters 14 and 15 cover scaling. We extend the engine to execute queries in
    parallel across CPU cores, then across distributed clusters.

    and benchmarking approaches for measuring performance.
