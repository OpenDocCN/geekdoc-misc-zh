    However, that is too simplistic. Racket’s power comes from its ability to define
    new languages: [this article](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/fffkbmt-programmable-prog-lang/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1695232021067394&usg=AOvVaw214fGxlshmCAnJzUJUG5dk)and
    [this brief video](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://youtu.be/R_1TnfCuxK8&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1695232021067621&usg=AOvVaw055kiEdpnPdwxtKaQRyL0R) discuss
    that in more detail. Indeed, some programs in this book are written in the Racket
    programming language (`#lang racket`), but many are in a language ideally designed
    for this book (`#lang plait`). In addition, other parts define their own languages:
    there are multiple SMoL languages and well over a dozen mystery languages. Thus,
    while the learner must demonstrate some forbearance for parenthetical syntax,
    in return they will be richly rewarded with learning experiences.'

- en: 'The existence of `#lang`, in some ways, drove this book’s redesign. I had some
    hand in that feature’s [design](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/cffk-macros-to-dsls/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1695232021068197&usg=AOvVaw2ek0jEgcbTPyCNMaXY6ktq),
    which made me acutely self-conscious: materials intended to be for a broad audience
    shouldn’t be about work too close to my heart. That was one of the reasons that,
    while the first edition used a predecessor of Racket, the second edition did not.
    In the process, however, I realized that I was depriving my students of numerous
    learning opportunities: after all, what better medium for the study of languages
    than a language designed for designing languages? For instance, the first version
    of the mystery languages were ad hoc and confusing; reimplementing them as a collection
    of Racket `#lang`s made them far simpler and clearer (and also open them up to
    be an object of direct study themselves). Thus, this edition doubles down (and
    then some) on the use of Racket. Getting it right can be tricky (e.g., avoiding
    mode confusion) and may take a few iterations, but it’s well worth the effort.'
