<h1>Welcome to Fast Track to Rust</h1>

<p>This course is designed to introduce you to the Rust programming language by
building an actual program. We'll be developing a grep-like program, called
rustle<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-1-1"><a href="#footnote-1">1</a></sup> with a minimal subset of the features found in the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/">GNU</a> <sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-2-1"><a href="#footnote-2">2</a></sup> <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/grep/manual/grep.html">grep</a>
<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-3-1"><a href="#footnote-3">3</a></sup> utility. This means we'll start with what we know and iterate upon the
design as we learn more about the language.</p>

<p>The goal is to teach you Rust, so it's assumed you don't know anything about the
language. However, it's also assumed that you have experience programming in
other languages like C++, and are familiar with multithreading, data structures,
and program memory organization (i.e., heap, stack, etc.).</p>
<p>This course moves relatively quickly. Most topics are covered enough to provide
a fundamental understanding. As you progress, references to the official Rust
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/title-page.html">documentation</a> are provided for further exploration.</p>
<p>Enough chit chat, let's get started!</p>

<p>The name Rustle was chosen because it's a play on the word "rust" and
represents the sound of leaves rustling as the program searches through
data. <a href="#fr-1-1">↩</a></p>

<p>Grep searches one or more input files for lines containing a match to a
specified pattern. By default, grep outputs the matching lines. <a href="#fr-3-1">↩</a></p>
