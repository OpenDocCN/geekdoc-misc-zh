    the creation of what is called abstract syntax. In abstract syntax, we represent
    the essence of the input, ignoring the superficial syntactic details. Thus, in
    abstract syntax, all of the above programs will have the exact same representation.'

- en: 'An abstract syntax is an in-computer representation of programs. There are
    many kinds of data we can use as a representation, so let’s think about the kinds
    of programs we might want to represent. For simplicity, we’ll assume that our
    language has only numbers and addition; once we can handle that, it’ll be easy
    to handle additional operations. Here are some sample (surface syntax) programs:'

- en: In conventional arithmetic notation, of course, we have to worry about the order
    of operations and what operations take precedence over what others. In abstract
    syntax, that’s another detail we want to ignore; we’ll instead assume that we
    are working internally with the equivalent of fully-parenthesized expressions,
    where all these issues have been resolved. Thus, it’s as if the last two expressions
    above were written as

    expression in its own right. This gives us a strong hint as to what kind of representation
    to use internally: a tree. Indeed, it’s so common to use abstract syntax trees that
    the abbreviation, AST, is routinely used without explanation; you can expect to
    see it in books, papers, blog posts, etc. on this topic.'

    takes a linearsentence and turns it into a tree-shaped representation of the grammatical
    structure. We want to do the same for programs.
