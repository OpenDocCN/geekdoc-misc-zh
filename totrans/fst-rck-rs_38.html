<h1>Generic Types</h1>
<blockquote>原文：<a href="https://freddiehaddad.github.io/fast-track-to-rust/generic_types.html">https://freddiehaddad.github.io/fast-track-to-rust/generic_types.html</a></blockquote>
                        
<p>Many programming languages include tools for effectively handling the
duplication of concepts, and Rust is no exception. Rust offers powerful support
for generics, a topic that could easily warrant its own book. However, since
we're on the Fast Track to Rust, we'll focus on the core concepts of generics
and traits by making the <code>interval</code> module from the previous section generic.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We've already been working with generics throughout this course, using types
such as <code>Vec&lt;T&gt;</code>, <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code>, and <code>Result&lt;T, E&gt;</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Similar to our approach in the previous section, we'll examine the helpful
compiler errors as we work towards making the <code>interval</code> module generic. The
rationale behind exposing you to these compiler errors is to illustrate how
beneficial the compiler can be when working with the language.</p>
<p>Let's get started!</p>
