- en: We're nearing the end of the course, and there's no better way to wrap things
    up than with concurrency! Rust, like many other languages, includes a native [thread](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/thread/)
    module for spawning threads and performing tasks in parallel. However, numerous
    crates build on Rust's native multithreading capabilities, simplifying the process
    and offering various threading patterns.

- en: For instance, if you've programmed in Go, you're likely familiar with channels
    for moving data between `goroutines`. Similarly, if you've worked with JavaScript,
    you probably know about `async` and `await`. Both of these paradigms, along with
    many others, are available as crates in Rust.
