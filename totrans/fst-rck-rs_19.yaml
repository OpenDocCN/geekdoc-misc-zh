- en: Ownership and borrowing are fundamental principles in Rust that ensure memory
    safety without needing a garbage collector. Ownership dictates how memory is managed,
    while borrowing allows you to reference data without taking ownership. Understanding
    these concepts is crucial for writing efficient and safe Rust programs.

    Ownership](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch04-00-understanding-ownership.html),
    and it's highly recommended to spend some time reading that material. For now,
    let's focus on the core principles of ownership.
