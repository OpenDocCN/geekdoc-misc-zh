    and distinguish shapes. Because it serves a very important gameplay function,
    you should do a **lighting pass** early in the level design process, before a
    proper art pass.'

    Many game lighting effects do not actually use any lighting systems.

    These lights can be *static* or *dynamic,* and **motivated** by a visible **light

    lights**, **fill lights**, and **rim lights** based on the light's orientation
    to the camera and subject.

    first, then light for wayfinding, and then for gameplay, and finally any last
    details or moods.

    After a lighting pass, you'll want to do an [optimization](/process/env-art/optimization)
    pass.
