- en: I hope that you found this book useful and that you now have a better understanding
    of the internals of query engines. If there are topics that you feel haven’t been
    covered adequately, or at all, I would love to hear about it so I can consider
    adding additional content in a future revision of this book.

    with these projects is a great way to learn more about the topic. Here are just
    a few examples of popular open-source query engines.

    YouTube ([here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSE8ODhjZXjasmrEd2_Yi1deeE360zv5O)).
    This covers much more than just query engines, but there is extensive content
    on query optimization and execution. I highly recommend watching these videos.

    Record Data](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page) data
    set. The yellow and green taxi trip records include fields capturing pick-up and
    drop-off dates/times, pick-up and drop-off locations, trip distances, itemized
    fares, rate types, payment types, and driver-reported passenger counts.
