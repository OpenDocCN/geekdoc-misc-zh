- en: We're going to create a type to represent an interval. Rust follows a standardized
    naming convention for types, where structures use `UpperCamelCase`^([1](#footnote-1))
    for "type-level" constructs. Therefore, we'll name our `struct` `Interval`.

    parameter) in your class methods. In Rust, the [`self`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/keyword.self.html)
    keyword is used to represent the receiver of a method and the convention is to
    omit the type for this parameter. Depending on the intended behavior, it can be
    specified as `self`, `&self` or `&mut self`.^([3](#footnote-3))

    As `Self` is an alias to the actual type, the full expansion would be `self: Interval`,

    to optimize the detection of overlapping intervals. However, this approach limits
    the versatility of our `Interval` type. As an exercise, you can work on making

    first interval is greater than or equal to the `start` of the next interval. The
    only caveat is the order of the comparison.
