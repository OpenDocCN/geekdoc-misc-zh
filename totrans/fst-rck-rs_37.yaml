- en: The first error indicates that the `Interval` type is not in scope. This is
    because it is now part of the `interval` module. To access it, we can use the
    full path name `interval::Interval` or create a shortcut with `use`. Since we
    don't want to replace every occurrence of `Interval` in our code with `interval::Interval`,
    we'll take advantage of `use`. Additionally, we need access to `IntervalError`,
    so we'll bring that into scope at the same time. When bringing multiple types
    into scope, we can wrap them in `{}` and separate them with `,`.

- en: Before we defined the `interval` module, all the types and their methods were
    public. However, once we enclosed everything in a module, they became private!
    By default, code within a module is private from its parent modules. To make a
    module public, we need to declare it with `pub mod` instead of just `mod`. Let's
    add the `pub` prefix and run the program again.

- en: More compiler errors! Who would have thought creating a module could be this
    complicated? The reason for this series of errors is to help us understand module
    scope and privacy. The emerging pattern is that modules default everything to
    private. Simply declaring the module public isn't enough; every type and method
    within the module must also be explicitly declared public if that is the intended
    design. So, let's prefix the methods and types with `pub` and hopefully achieve
    a successful compile!

- en: Alright, last time, I promise! As a final note on privacy, and as the compiler
    error pointed out, even the fields of a `struct` are private by default. So, the
    last step is to make the fields public. Let's do that and finally achieve a successful
    compile. Fingers crossed!
