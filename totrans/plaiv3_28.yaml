- en: But now we run into a problem. What is the result of calling `(calc c)`? We
    expect it to be some kind of Boolean value. But we don’t have Boolean values in
    the language!

- en: That’s not all. Above, we have written both `(calc t)`and `(calc e)`. However,
    the whole point of a conditional is that we don’t want to evaluate both, only
    one. So we have to pick which one to evaluate based on some criterion.
