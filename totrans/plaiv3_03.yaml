    it is more meaningful to think of programming languages as aggregates of features.
    The features are the building blocks. Of course, once combined, languages are
    more like compounds than like mixtures: the features interact in ways that may
    not be easy to predict. Understanding both the features and their compositions
    is then a valuable way to approach a language.'

    This is the embodiment of the computational core of many of our widely-used programming
    languages, from C# and Java to JavaScript, Lua, Python, and Ruby to OCaml and
    Racket. The astute reader will notice that this commonality pays no respect to
    “paradigms”. Rather, all these languages (and many others), to a large extent,
    have a common computational core: safe runtime systems, automated memory management,
    eager evaluation, first-class lexically-scoped functions, first-order mutable
    variables, and first-class mutable structures. Contemporary programming demands
    a deep understanding of these. For instance, I believe you cannot make sense of
    concurrency with mutation, static members, or ownership, without understanding
    SMoL.'

    malleable material, even “standard” features have historically seen variation.
    Therefore, while we progress acrossfeatures, we also want to study variation withinthem.
    We do this by using the [mystery language](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/pkf-teach-pl-exp-adv-think/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1695232021064466&usg=AOvVaw0VIwT72D0WNabBksW4GD3x)approach:
    with a fixed syntax, we explore the different ways the same feature can behave.
    This hopes to build on the cognitive theory of [contrasting cases](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.cultofpedagogy.com/contrasting-cases/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1695232021064751&usg=AOvVaw1sitvi37D-BaEv1xrf6erl) to

    across a large number of diverse languages (like static types), or shows too much
    variation between languages (like objects), I argue that it’s no longer part of
    the standardmodel. But it is not a value judgment: in this book we explore SMoL
    in some depth,  then turn our attention to several non-“standard” features that
    are not only important but also beautiful and fascinating.'

    Implementation Plan. This is the idea that programming languages are usefully
    thought of in terms of an abstract syntax tree; this tree is represented well
    by an algebraic datatype; and a program that processes this tree is a recursive
    function that is largely guided by the structure of the type. This level of description
    encompasses both the standard media for evaluation, interpreters and compilers.
    It also captures the essence of type-checkers, type inference, static analysis,
    and more. Thus, students should gain facility with this structure for when they
    want to implement their own language experiments.'
