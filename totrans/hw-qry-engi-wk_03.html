<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>Query engines are the invisible workhorses powering modern data infrastructure. Every time you run a SQL query against a database, execute a Spark job, or query a data lake, a query engine is transforming your high-level request into an efficient execution plan. Understanding how query engines work gives you insight into one of the most important abstractions in computing.</p>
<p>This book takes a hands-on approach to demystifying query engines. Rather than surveying existing systems, we will build a fully functional query engine from scratch, covering each component in enough depth that you could implement your own.</p>
<h2 id="who-this-book-is-for"><a class="header" href="#who-this-book-is-for">Who This Book Is For</a></h2>
<p>This book is for software engineers who want to understand the internals of query engines. You might be:</p>
<ul>
<li>A data engineer who wants to understand why queries perform the way they do</li>
<li>A database developer looking to learn foundational concepts</li>
<li>A software engineer curious about compiler-like systems</li>
<li>Someone building tooling that needs to parse or analyze SQL</li>
</ul>
<p>Basic programming knowledge is assumed. The examples use Kotlin, chosen for its conciseness, but the concepts apply to any language.</p>
<h2 id="what-you-will-learn"><a class="header" href="#what-you-will-learn">What You Will Learn</a></h2>
<p>By the end of this book, you will understand how to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Design a columnar type system using Apache Arrow</li>
<li>Build data source connectors for CSV and Parquet files</li>
<li>Represent queries as logical and physical plans</li>
<li>Create a DataFrame API for building queries programmatically</li>
<li>Translate logical plans into executable physical plans</li>
<li>Implement query optimizations like projection and predicate push-down</li>
<li>Parse SQL and convert it to query plans</li>
<li>Execute queries in parallel across multiple CPU cores</li>
<li>Design distributed query execution across a cluster</li>
</ul>

<p>The book follows the natural architecture of a query engine, building each layer on top of the previous.</p>
<p>Chapters 1 through 4 cover the foundations. We start with what a query engine is, then establish our foundation with Apache Arrow for the memory model, a type system for representing data, and data source abstractions for reading files.</p>
<p>Chapters 5 through 7 cover query representation. We define logical plans and expressions to represent queries abstractly, build a DataFrame API for constructing plans programmatically, and add SQL support so queries can be written in the familiar query language.</p>
<p>Chapters 8 through 10 cover execution. We translate logical plans into physical plans containing executable code, then cover joins and subqueries, two of the most complex operations in query processing.</p>
<p>Chapters 11 through 13 cover planning and optimization. We implement a query planner to automate the translation from logical to physical plans, build optimizer rules to transform plans into more efficient forms, and execute queries to compare performance.</p>
<p>Chapters 14 and 15 cover scaling. We extend the engine to execute queries in parallel across CPU cores, then across distributed clusters.</p>
<p>Chapters 16 and 17 cover quality. We cover testing strategies including fuzzing, and benchmarking approaches for measuring performance.</p>
