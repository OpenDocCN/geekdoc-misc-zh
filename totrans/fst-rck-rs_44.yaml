- en: The simplest way to enable multithreading support in our rustle program is to
    spawn a thread for each specified file, perform the pattern matching steps we've
    developed, and print the results using a fork/join pattern. If you have a C++
    background, you might start by exploring the functions in the [thread](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/thread/)
    module, discovering the [spawn](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/thread/fn.spawn.html)
    function, and diving right in.

    it will likely be time-consuming, frustrating, and confusing. Let's examine some
    of the pitfalls of this approach and then explore a more effective solution.

- en: The `spawn` function takes a closure (`f`) as an argument, spawns a new thread
    to run the closure, and returns a [`JoinHandle`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/thread/struct.JoinHandle.html).
    As the name suggests, the `JoinHandle` provides a [`join`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/thread/struct.JoinHandle.html#method.join)
    method to wait for the spawned thread to finish. So far, so good. However, the
    `'static`^([1](#footnote-1)) constraint on `F` and the return value `T` is where,
    as the Bard would say, lies the rub.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The `'static` constraint requires that the closure and its return value must
    live for the entire duration of the program's execution. This is necessary because
    threads can outlive the context in which they were created.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If a thread, and by extension its return value, can outlive its caller, we need
    to ensure they remain valid afterward. Since we *can't* predict when the thread
    will finish, they must be valid until the end of the program. Hence, the `'static`
    lifetime.

    about code that would run without issues in most other languages? Even though
    it''s not the case in this example, in a more general sense, the spawned thread

    worked. The value was *copied* into the scope of the spawned thread, making it
    independent from the original and solving the lifetime problem. The variable is
    now guaranteed to live for as long as the thread. This works fine for primitive
    types and types implementing the `Copy` trait. But what if copying is an expensive
    operation, or the object can''t be copied? This leads to the next challenge that
    developers learning Rust often face: what happens if we need to spawn additional
