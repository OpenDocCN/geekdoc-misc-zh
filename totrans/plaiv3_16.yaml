    out how to represent programs.

- en: Of course, computers represent programs all the time. When we’re writing code,
    our text editor holds the program source. Every executable on disk and in memory
    is a representation of a program. When we visit a Web page, it sends down a JavaScript
    program. These are all programs represented in the computer. But all these are
    a bit inconvenient for our needs, and we’ll come up with a better representation
    in a moment.

    And interesting! And important! People get really attached to some surface syntaxes
    over the other (you may already be having some feelings about Racket’s parenthetical
    syntax…I certainly do). You can even write that expression as

    distraction in terms of getting to understand the models underlying languages.
    Therefore, we need a way to represent all these different programs in a way that
    ignores these distinctions.
