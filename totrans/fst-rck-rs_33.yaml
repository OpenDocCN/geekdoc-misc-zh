- en: 'Rust provides two options for creating custom types: [`enum`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/items/enumerations.html)
    and [`struct`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/items/structs.html). The key
    difference between them is that enums have a fixed set of variants, meaning they
    are used to indicate that a value is one of a specific set of possible values.
    On the other hand, [`struct`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/items/structs.html)
    is not limited to a set of possible values. Structures allow for packaging related
    values into meaningful groups.'

- en: In our current rustle program, we use tuples to represent intervals. In this
    section, we'll replace tuples with a custom `Interval` type using a [`struct`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/items/structs.html),
    and enhance it by adding methods for various operations. Finally, we'll define
    an [`enum`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/items/enumerations.html) to represent
    potential error values when creating and interacting with intervals.
