As we reach the end of this journey, I am pleased to present the final version of the rustle program, ready for production use. To compile a release version, be sure to use `cargo build --release`. I hope you have enjoyed this journey as much as I have enjoyed guiding you through it. Thank you very much for completing the course. Have fun on your Rust journey!
