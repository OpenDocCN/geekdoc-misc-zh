- en: This course is designed to introduce you to the Rust programming language by
    building an actual program. We'll be developing a grep-like program, called rustle^([1](#footnote-1))
    with a minimal subset of the features found in the [GNU](https://www.gnu.org/)
    ^([2](#footnote-2)) [grep](https://www.gnu.org/software/grep/manual/grep.html)
    ^([3](#footnote-3)) utility. This means we'll start with what we know and iterate
    upon the design as we learn more about the language.

- en: The goal is to teach you Rust, so it's assumed you don't know anything about
    the language. However, it's also assumed that you have experience programming
    in other languages like C++, and are familiar with multithreading, data structures,
    and program memory organization (i.e., heap, stack, etc.).

- en: This course moves relatively quickly. Most topics are covered enough to provide
    a fundamental understanding. As you progress, references to the official Rust
    [documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/title-page.html) are provided for
    further exploration.

    the sound of leaves rustling as the program searches through data. [↩](#fr-1-1)
