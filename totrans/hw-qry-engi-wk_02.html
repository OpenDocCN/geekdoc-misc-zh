<p>The first edition of this book was written in a one week break between jobs and improved during COVID lockdown in 2020. I honestly wasn’t sure how many people wanted to read a book about building a query engine from scratch. It turns out that there are quite a few.</p>
<p>This second edition is a significant revision with clearer explanations, better code organization, and expanded coverage of topics like joins, subqueries, and distributed query execution.</p>
<p>This book is not academic in nature. It aims to be a practical, straightforward guide. The feedback from readers has been encouraging, so thank you to everyone who provided suggestions and corrections. I hope this edition serves as an even better foundation for understanding query engines.</p>
