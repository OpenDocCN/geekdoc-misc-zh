# Installation

Most exercises in this book can be completed in your web browser, with a few exceptions. However, it is recommended to install the Rust development toolchain on your system. Once installed, you'll have everything you need to build and run Rust code locally.

Installation is accomplished using `rustup`, the Rust toolchain installer. Once completed, you'll have `rustup`, `cargo`, and `rustc`.

Follow the instructions at [https://rustup.rs/](https://rustup.rs/) to complete the installation.

## [Configuring your IDE](#configuring-your-ide)

It is recommended (but not required) to configure your editor to work with Rust. With Cargo installed, most editors, such as VS Code, will automatically install [rust-analyzer](https://rust-analyzer.github.io/), the LSP implementation for the Rust programming language.
